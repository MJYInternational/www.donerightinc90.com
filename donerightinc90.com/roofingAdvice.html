							<h5>How long does a roof last?</h5>
							<p>Roofs generally last 15-30 years. There is a big variance based on type of roofing and how it was installed! Most roofs I have seen could last another year or two if needed. As a home owner you looking at the roof from the ground is not a good indication if it need replacement. Try to find paper work on when it was installed? Next get an inspection of the roof by a roofing contractor. If you ask only for an estimate of a new roof more than likely the Sales person will not mention that your current roof could last longer. This would affect their sales and there paycheck on Friday. We offer an inspection for $125 if turns out you need repairs it can be deducted from repair cost. You may have a few more year left saving you thousands of dollars! Done Right is committed to saving you time and money and we believe that this roofing inspection fee is a small price to pay for something that could have a large return on investment. Fill out the contact form on the side if you would like an inspection done on your roof. We promise that you will be very pleased with the inspection.</p>

							<h5>Are metal roofs good?</h5>
							<p>Metal roofs can look like tile or shake they are rated up to 50 years of life. They are a great roof but can be PROBLEM IS THEY DAMAGED WHEN WALK ON. When you clean gutters add dish to the roof. Termite tenting or if you have 2nd story and need painting damage occurs in the form of dented tiles. This can be fixed but is not cheap $1000-$2000. To replace dented tiles. Also they are more expensive to install.</p>

							<h5>Are tile roofs good roofs?</h5>
							<p>Concrete tile roof is heavy and if your house was not built for it and does not have tile on now some support may be needed and an engineer to sign off to put it on. They look great but cost is higher. Lightweight concrete tile roofs are more popular more house can have them installed without framing being changed! PROBLEM IS THEY DAMAGED WHEN WALK ON. When you clean gutters add dish to the roof. Termite tenting or if you have 2nd story and need painting damage occurs in the form of broken tiles. This can be fixed but is not cheap $500-$1000. To replace broken tiles. The number one roof I repair every winter is tile roofs.</p>

						<div class="advice">
							<h5>What type of Roof Should I get?</h5>
							<p>Ok let's look at this from your prospective, the type of neighborhood you live in. What types of roofs are being installed there? Do you live in the hills with fire danger? Whist is on your neighbor roof. These are questions you should ask before purchasing the roof. The roofing contractor will try and sell you what type he puts on this may not match your goals and he will do his best to persuade you to his type of roofing. Look at your budget borrowing money to put on the super duper roof when the regular roof will do. Once the roof on 2 weeks later you will hardly think about it, you will walk into your house every day not thinking about the roof more than likely.</p>
